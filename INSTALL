phpChain 2.0 - Install
======================

-- Setup instructions.

You will need:

1. Apache with mod_ssl support.
        See http://www.modssl.org

2. PHP with mcrypt and MySQL support.
        See http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mcrypt.php

3. MySQL. 
        See http://www.mysql.com


Configuring the above is beyond the scope of this documentation. Each of the
referenced sites should give you enough information to get going.

Step 1:

Rename the file config/config.dist.php to config/config.php and configure 
username, password and database name. Optionally, if your MySQL server is not
localhost, modify the host here as well.

Step 2:

Move all the files to location of your SSL configured website. Go to the site
in your browser and verify that everything works. Create a user. Login. Create
some categories. Try making an entry in the database. Make sure you are able
to retrieve it. (NOTE! Passwords are hidden from the screen by default, to
prevent people reading over your shoulder. To display the password for an 
entry, move the mouse over the password field for that entry.)

-- Known problems.

There's no way to prevent anyone from creating a new login. The site you setup
is effectively public. To work around this, either use .htaccess files to 
restrict access to the site, or remove the newlogin.php file once you've
created logins.
