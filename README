phpChain 2.0 - Readme
=====================

-- Requirements

The system requires PHP 4.3.0 with MySQL support, and libmcrypt 
support. See this page for information on mcrypt:

- PHP 4.3.0 or higher
- MySQL 4.1.0 or higher

http://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.mcrypt.php

It's STRONGLY recommended that you run this system on a web server with 
SSL support. If the site is not secured using SSL, the whole point of 
having a secure database is lost. Configuring SSL is beyond the scope 
of this document. See the following site for information:

http://www.modssl.org/

========================================================================
IF YOU DO NOT USE SSL, YOUR PASSWORDS WILL BE SENT PLAINTEXT OVER THE 
INTERNET!
========================================================================

The system was built on and tested with apache 1.3.27, PHP 4.3.2, 
mod_ssl 2.8.14 with OpenSSL 0.9.7b, all running on Linux. Other 
platforms may also work, but have not been tested.
