# PasswordChain 2.1.1 (OpenSSL)
-
Requirements

The system requires PHP 7.1.0 with MySQL support, and php_openssl.so/php_openssl.dll 
support:

- PHP 7.1.0 or higher
- MySQL/MariaDB 5.5.58 or higher
- OpenSSL 1.1.1i
- gost-engine 1.1.0.3

It's STRONGLY recommended that you run this system on a web server with 
SSL support. If the site is not secured using SSL, the whole point of 
having a secure database is lost. Configuring SSL is beyond the scope 
of this document.
